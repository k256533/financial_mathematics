# Financial Mathematics Project Repository

Hello! This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that I built for my class project. 

It explores various financial mathematics concepts and numerical methods applied to option pricing. 

Each notebook is structured to provide insights into different financial models and their practical applications.

## Project Notebooks

### 1. **Monte Carlo Call Option**
   - **Filename**: `Monte_Carlo_Call_Option.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Implements a Monte Carlo simulation method to price call options and analyzes the convergence and accuracy of the method.

### 2. **Monte Carlo Spread Option**
   - **Filename**: `Monte_Carlo_Spread_Option.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Uses Monte Carlo simulation to price spread options, focusing on correlation sensitivity.

### 3. **Numerical Call Option Pricing**
   - **Filename**: `Numerical_Call_Option_Pricing.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Evaluates various numerical methods for call option pricing, including Finite Difference methods and Monte Carlo simulations, with a comparison of their performance.

### 4. **Dynamic Delta Hedging**
   - **Filename**: `Dynamic_Delta_Hedging.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Analyzes the performance of a dynamic delta hedging strategy across different frequencies to manage the risk of an options portfolio.

### 5. **Forward Pricing**
   - **Filename**: `Forward_Pricing.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Discusses the numerical approaches to forward contract pricing, with implementation of related mathematical models.
